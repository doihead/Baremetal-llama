# Chipyard Baremetal-IDE

Baremetal-IDE is an all-in-one tool for baremetal-level C/C++ program developments. It is part of the Chipyard ecosystem.

Baremetal-IDE features peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debugging tools for multiple RISC-V SoCs. With the board support package, user can use either the hardware-abstraction layer (HAL) functions to quickly configure and use the various supported peripheral devices, or can use the low-level (LL) macro definitions to generate code with minimal memory footprint and high performance. The modularity of the framework structure also allows fast integration of new SoCs.
